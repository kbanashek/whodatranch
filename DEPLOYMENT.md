## Option 3: Traditional Web Hosting

If you have existing web hosting (GoDaddy, Bluehost, HostGator, etc.):

### Steps:

1. **Build your site:**

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

   Add to `next.config.js`:

   ```javascript
   module.exports = {
     output: "export",
   };
   ```

   Then run:

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

3. **Upload files:**
   - Find the `out` folder
   - Upload all contents via FTP/cPanel
   - Point domain to this folder

**Note:** This method won't support server-side features, but the site will work perfectly as a static site.
